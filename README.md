# Hi, I’m Jorge 👋

Full-stack developer and AI engineer, focused on building **useful, well-designed systems** at the intersection of **product, UX, and applied AI**.

I’ve worked across fintech, crypto, enterprise software, and early-stage startups and I care deeply about **clarity, leverage, and systems with the right level of complexity**.

## 🧭 What I’m building now

### 🚀 FindSimilarStartups (FSS)
An AI-powered competitive intelligence platform for founders.

- Rapid discovery of similar startups across multiple sources
- Deep, agent-based research pipelines
- Designed as a **tool for discovery and invention**, not just analysis
- Bootstrapped, product-led, founder-first

> The long-term vision is FSS as a **thinking partner for invention**:
> “I want to build X → here’s what exists, what’s missing, and where the opportunity lies.”

## 🧠 Areas of focus

- LLM-powered systems & agent orchestration  
- AI-assisted research and discovery workflows  
- Frontend architecture for complex products  
- Human-centered design for technical tools  
- Turning vague ideas into structured, usable systems  

---

## 🧩 Selected experience

- **Autodesk** — enterprise-grade software development  
- **Central Bank of Chile** — technical support & systems exposure  
- **Cumplo (Fintech)** — software development  
- **Orionx (Crypto exchange)** — frontend engineering  
- **FindSimilarStartups** — founder, product, engineering  

I’ve seen systems from **regulated institutions** to **zero-to-one startups**, which strongly shapes how I design products.

## 📐 How I think about building

- Good systems have **just enough complexity**
- UX is a **core feature**, not polish
- AI should **reduce cognitive load**, not add magic
- Feedback loops > static outputs
- Shipping > theorizing

I’m heavily influenced by **human-centered design**, systems thinking, and real-world constraints.

## 🌱 Outside of code

- Lot's of training
- Deep conversations, books, and quiet cafés  
- Short weekend escapes & sunsets  
- Long-form thinking about meaning, systems, and craft  

I value **discipline, reflection, and long-term arcs** — in both life and work.
